Start a nodeJS server
 which will be doing 30 seconds job (simple looping) for url ‘/job’ returning ‘OK’
 and also delivers a page with progress bar for url ‘/bar’.

Draw a progress bar by means of native CSS, JS, AJAX facilities.
 JS script should make an AJAX call which triggers heavy
 operation and updates progress bar according to job state.
